# Hashing
In this section we will attempt to go one step further by building a data structure that can be searched in O(1) time. This concept is referred to as hashing.  In order to do this, we will need to know even more about where the items might be when we go to look for them in the collection. If every item is where it should be, then the search can use a single comparison to discover the presence of an item.
